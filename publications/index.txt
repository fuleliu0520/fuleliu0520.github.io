Our findings indicate that public data openness significantly enhances firms' innovation efficiency, and this core result remains robust to a series of endogeneity checks.

Utilizing a multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) model and bond data from listed companies in high-polluting industries between 2010 and 2021, this study finds that these policies significantly reduce financing costs. Three distinct mechanisms mediate this effect: increased green innovation, improved environmental performance, and enhanced corporate social responsibility. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that state-owned enterprises, smaller firms, and longer-term bonds benefit more and experience a greater reduction in financing costs.

}19:T411,In recent decades, China’s rapid economic growth has been accompanied by increasingly severe environmental challenges. To address these issues and achieve sustainable development, enterprises have actively pursued green transition and technological upgrades. This study explores the relationship between common institutional ownership and corporate green transition by analyzing data from Chinese listed companies spanning 2007 to 2020. The findings reveal that common institutional ownership significantly promotes green transition, primarily through improvements in corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and advancements in digital transformation. Further analysis identifies environmental regulations and analyst attention as critical moderating factors influencing this relationship. These findings suggest that companies should actively collaborate with institutional investors to accelerate green transition efforts, while policymakers should design targeted incentives and regulatory frameworks to facilitate this process.1a:T6bf,@article{su_common_2025,
